## 🎓 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Nano Was Slow Before:
1. ❌ High temperature (0.5) = Random behavior = Retries
2. ❌ Verbose prompts (3000 tokens) = Confusion = Errors
3. ❌ No caching = Every task calls LLM = Inefficient
4. ❌ Weak error handling = Parse errors = More retries
5. ❌ Single actions = Multiple calls = Slow round-trips

### Why Nano Is Fast Now:
1. ✅ Low temperature (0.15) = Deterministic = First-try success
2. ✅ Focused prompts (800 tokens) = Clear instructions = Accuracy
3. ✅ Action caching = Skip LLM for patterns = Efficiency
4. ✅ Smart error handling = Parse most outputs = Reliability
5. ✅ Ready for batching = Fewer round-trips = Speed
